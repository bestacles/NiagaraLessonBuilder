    "activity_2": "Guided Practice on Measuring Angles\n\n\nIntroduce the slide titled \u201cWhat Is a Protractor?\u201d explaining that it is a tool used to measure how wide an angle is.\nUse a slide \u201cHow to Measure an Angle\u201d with these child-friendly steps:\nPut the Protractor in Place: Place the middle of the flat side of the protractor right on the corner (vertex) of the angle.\nLine Up the Angle: Make sure one side of the angle lines up with the 0\u00b0 mark.\nRead the Number: Look where the other side points\u2014the number is the angle\u2019s measurement.\nTransition to the slide \u201cMeasuring Angles with Our Protractor,\u201d where you overlay your transparent PNG of a protractor on three angle examples (Angle A, Angle B, Angle C).\nGuidelines:\n  Make sure the protractor image is visible and that each step is clearly animated.\n  Remind students to watch closely and think about each step before the answer is revealed.\n  Use clear and concise language, and repeat steps if needed.\n  Encourage students to ask questions if they\u2019re unsure about any part of the process.\n\n\nTeacher Prompts:\n  \u201cWhat do you notice about where the 0\u00b0 mark is on our protractor? \u201d\n  \u201cBefore I reveal the measurement for Angle A, who can guess if it\u2019s acute, right, or obtuse?\u201d\n  \u201cIf you were measuring this angle at home, what step would you do first?\u201d",
    "activity_3": "Independent Practice\nTask: \n  Distribute or display the independent practice worksheet.\n  Instructions on the slide: \u201cYour Turn! Look at each angle on your worksheet. Use a protractor (or the strategies we learned) to decide if each angle is acute (less than 90\u00b0), right (exactly 90\u00b0), or obtuse (more than 90\u00b0). Write your answers.\u201d\nGuidelines:\n  Ensure every student has access to a copy.\n  Remind students to take their time and double-check their work.\n  Walk around to provide support to those who need extra help.\n  Encourage collaboration or discussion in small groups if appropriate, while ensuring each student works independently.\n\n\nTeacher Prompts:\n  \u201cWho would like to share the answer for the first angle? Tell us if it\u2019s acute, right, or obtuse!\u201d\n  \u201cWhat was the trickiest angle to decide on, and why do you think that was?\u201d\n  \u201cDoes anyone have a strategy they used to figure out the measurement that worked really well?\u201d",
    "technology": "Overhead Projector/Interactive Whiteboard: Used to display the printed slides and demonstrations of how to measure angles using a transparent protractor image.\nPrinted Materials: Hard copies of the worksheet, angle diagrams, and protractor examples will be provided to all students.\nTraditional Tools: Chalk/markers, a physical protractor, and a whiteboard for live demonstrations.",
    "unfinished": "If students do not complete their worksheet in class:\nThey will finish the independent practice worksheet as homework and bring their completed work to the next lesson for review.\n\n\nFor early finishers:\nThey will be given an extension challenge: Find two additional examples of angles in the classroom or at home, classify each as acute, right, or obtuse, and write a short explanation for each.\nAlternatively, early finishers can write a brief reflection describing the steps they use to measure an angle with a protractor in their own words.",
    "alt_plan": "If any issues arise during the lesson (for example, if the overhead projector or interactive board is unavailable), I will:\nVerbally describe key visuals and demonstrations while using a traditional whiteboard or chalkboard to sketch the protractor, angles, and measurement steps.\nDistribute printed copies of the worksheet and angle diagrams ahead of time so that every student has a physical reference.\nIf student engagement is low (e.g., few responses during discussion), I will:\nRandomly call on students and use quick visual prompts (such as \u201cShow me your angle using your arms\u201d or \u201cRaise your hand if you think this angle is acute\u201d) to stimulate participation.",

What surprised you about angles today? Think about one thing you learned and share it in the chat.\u201d\nWrap-Up: Summarize and thank students for their participation.\nTransition: Move to the exit ticket activity.",
    "formal_assessment": "Independent Practice Worksheet:\n  Rationale: \n    This worksheet directly measures students\u2019 ability to identify, classify, and measure angles. Achieving 80% or higher indicates mastery.\n\nExit Ticket:\n  Rationale: \n    The exit ticket (answering \u201cWhat type of angle is shown at 3:00 on a clock?\u201d) provides a quick, clear measure of understanding of key concepts.",
    "informal_assessment": "Class Discussions and Responses:\n  Rationale: \n    Monitoring responses during guided practice and discussions offers real-time feedback on student understanding.\n\nTeacher Observation:\n  Rationale: \n    Observing student participation during the hands-on activities (e.g., arm movements and independent practice) helps identify areas needing further clarification.",
